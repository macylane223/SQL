#This project analyzes data from a superstore:

#First, I ordered all items by price.
SELECT(price)
FROM superstore
ORDER BY price ASC;

#Then, I added all of the prices of the items together.
SELECT SUM(price)
FROM superstore;

#Next, I averaged the price of all kitchen supply items.
SELECT AVG(price)
FROM superstore
WHERE category="Kitchen Supplies";

#Lastly, I answered the question of how many electronics are in stock.
SELECT SUM(stock_quantity)
FROM superstore
WHERE category="Electronics";
